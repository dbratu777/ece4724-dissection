## Product History

Before covering the SL-100L Dual Leaf Pocket Calculator's history, it is only right to start with the unique history of its creator, CASIO. CASIO has a history of innovation and creativity that seeps into every aspect of its existence, including its corporate philosophy; their mission is simple, "through the power to put wonder at hand, bring new levels of joy to lives one by one..." [\[1\]](#1-casio-philosophy-casiocom).

The following figures showcase CASIO's historical contributions to the calculator scene, which include one of the first calculators in CASIO's SL product line.

The Film Card SL-800 had a sleek and striking design, which gained it purchase to the Museum of Modern Art's archive [\[3\]](#3-moma-film-card-solar-calculator-momaorg). This calculator encompasses the same range of functionality as the SL-100L and originally sold for ¥5,900, or approximately $80.27 in today's money [\[4\]](#4-casio-calculator-collectors-casio-sl-800-d-casio-calculatorcom)[\[5\]](#5-pound-sterling-us-dollar--japanese-yen-historical-reference-rates-from-bank-of-england-for-1983-poundsterlinglivecom)[\[6\]](#6-us-inflation-calculator-inflation-calculator-usinflationcalculatorcom). Nearly 30 years after the release of the SL-800, the SL-100L became publicly available.

**Figure 9: Maizoon JS-732A Folding Clamshell Calculator** [\[13\]](#13-amazon-maizoon-solar-dual-power-calculator-with-12-digit-display-large-screen-folding-flip-cover-big-button-portable-computing-tool-for-finance-business-office-and-school-amazoncom)

The Maizoon calculator is especially interesting as it is the only off-brand calculator shown in this section; this model of calculator is also listed online as the JOINUS JS-732A/CT-8855V, the Neel CT-8855V, and the CITHZEN CT-8855V. It has a very tactile appearance and claims to be powered off AAA batteries in addition to solar. It also boasts comparison operators (greater than and less than) as part of its specialty functionality.

While some of the other devices may provide unique features, none of them match the sleek form factor, tasteful appearance, or accessible presentation of CASIO's SL-100L; the [Canon LS-555H](#canon-ls-555h) comes close, but lacks the refinement required to justify its higher price point.
