<p>The keyboard serves as the primary point of user interaction with the
device; it provides a number of potential actions or operations to the
user depending on the current state. As shown in the above figure, green
states represent actions available to the user at any point; although,
many of these states may not produce the desired behavior unless
specific conditions are met, such as the memory operations. Yellow
states require the preceding states or conditions to have occurred
before they are available to the user, e.g. an operand must be entered
before selecting an operator. Red states are terminal states managed and
determined by the device’s internal logic.</p>
<h2 id="timing-diagrams">Timing Diagrams</h2>
<p>The following timing diagrams were taken in moderately lit
conditions; the battery was removed and the solar cell provided a supply
voltage of ~1.3V DC. The periods and frequencies of the signals are not
dependant on the supply voltage; however, the amplitude, or peak-to-peak
voltages, of the signals are dependant on the supply voltage (this is
discussed further in the Electronic Characteristics section of the <a
href="../html/analysis.html">Product Analysis</a>).</p>

<p><br></p>
<p>Analysis of the 27-pin interface revealed the presence of 3 common
plane pins and 24 segment pins, which together support all 72 segments
(3 * 24) on the display (made up of 8 seven-segment digits, 8 decimal
points, 5 commas, 1 negative sign, 1 exponential indicator, and 1 memory
indicator).</p>
<p>The timing diagrams reveal that the LCD is driven using 4 voltage
levels: ±1.25V, ±1.3V, ±1.42, and GND (0V). Based on the these voltage
levels, the timing diagrams, and earlier pin analysis, it was concluded
that the LCD is multiplexed, or dynamic, and operates using a 1/3 bias
driving scheme.</p>
<p><strong><em>Bias = 1 / (# Voltage Levels - 1)</em></strong></p>
<p>Interestingly, regardless of the number of digits input or the type
of digit (0-9), all numerical segment pins seemingly produce one of two
AC signals; there was no difference in voltage amplitude, signal shape,
or RMS values within these signal types. However, this behavior may be
explained through multiplexed LCDs use of time-division control where
all segment pins are driven with similar waveforms; in other words, the
relative timing between segment and common signals is what determines
the display output and not necessarily the shape or amplitude of a
single pin’s waveform. Regardless, this makes it difficult to determine
exactly which pins line up with which segments.</p>

<p>The keyboard uses a standard multiplexed row-column matrix
arrangement, where each key press connects a specific row and column.
The microcontroller detects the key press by scanning the row and column
lines and determining which intersection/key was activated/pressed.</p>

<p>The timing diagram above shows the signal resulting from single a
button press. Although the button was pressed only once, the signal
shows multiple rapid transitions; this is caused by switch bounce, which
means the physical contacts on the back of the pressed key and the
keypad’s internal PCB make and break contact several times before
settling.</p>
<p>To prevent these bounces from being interpreted as separate inputs,
the microcontroller implements debouncing logic; this logic is typically
implemented by introducing a short delay after the initial press is
detected or by waiting until no input is received for a set period
before accepting further input from any key. In this particular
instance, the MCU utilizes the latter approach, as holding a button down
does not cause repeated key reads.</p>
