<p>The battery and solar cells serve as primary power sources for the
calculator; the keyboard and LCD are I/O devices with all logic required
to read from and write to them handled by the microcontroller. The
battery is portrayed as providing and receiving power, but it is
important to note that the “received” power from the solar cell is
actually blocked from the battery as discussed in next section.</p>

<p>The two Schottky diodes, with low voltage dropouts of 0.15V, prevent
the backflow of voltage from the solar cell across the MCU into the
battery and vice versa. As such, the solar cells are not capable of
recharging the battery and only extend its lifetime indirectly by
providing an alternative power source to drive the microcontroller.</p>
<h2 id="electronic-characteristics">Electronic Characteristics</h2>
<p>The device is primarily powered by a 1.5V alkaline button cell
battery, the LR1130. This battery is reported as having a capacity
between 50 – 80 mAh <a
href="#ref1">[1]</a>. The
maximum voltage out generated by the solar cells is 2.5V. So, it is
assumed that normal operations for the device occur within the 1.5 –
2.5V range.</p>

<p>It should be noted that the current draw of the LCD pins is largely
negligible, as LCDs behave like capacitive loads rather than resistive
ones. Current does not flow continuously through the segments to
determine whether they are on or off. Instead, the appearance of each
segment is determined by the voltage difference (or potential) between
the segment and its common plane; larger voltage differences correspond
to darker, more visible segments.</p>
<p>The small currents that are observed on each pin appear as brief
spikes during voltage transitions (the jumps between peaks and troughs),
caused by the charging and discharging of the segment’s capacitance.
These are not sustained currents; instead, they are a byproduct of the
LCD’s capacitive nature.</p>
<p>Sample images showing the LCD behavior at each tested voltage level
have been provided below.</p>

<p>At a slight angle, the segments intended to be displayed are slightly

<p><br></p>
<p>Regardless of the supply voltage level, each of the LCD pins
transmits AC signals with a net DC voltage of 0V to prevent degradation
of the liquid crystal material. The microcontroller (MCU) has no
measurable load between the power source and its corresponding input
pins. While there is likely some internal resistance, there is no
practical way to determine the MCU’s total current draw. Therefore, the
estimated battery lifetime provided below is based solely on the
measured current draw of the LCD’s common plane pins, taken at the
nominal supply voltage of 1.5V.</p>
<p><strong>50 mAh / 0.6 mA = 83.3 hours</strong></p>
<p><strong>80 mAh / 0.6 mA = 133.3 hours</strong></p>
<p>The total battery usage is offset by the solar cells when sufficient
light is present, so the actual battery lifetime is likely significantly
longer than 83.3 – 133.3 hours. These results can simply be used to
represent the potential battery range in an absolute absence of
light.</p>
<h2 id="bill-of-materials">Bill of Materials</h2>
<p>The cost of the microcontroller is not directly discussed in this
section as it is obscured and likely CASIO propriety; however, it is
worth noting that the MCU is a chip-on-board application-specific
integrated-chip (ASIC) obscured by black epoxy. This method of directly
mounting the die to the board and coating it with epoxy is done to
minimize manufacturing costs.</p>
<p>Many of the components used in the device are now obsolete or are
marked with manufacturer-specific codes, such as the diodes, LCD, and
solar cells. As such, best-fit components have been selected, based on
the measured ratings, appearance, and functionality of each component,
to estimate the approximate bill of materials in the following
subsections. Where possible, bulk prices were used for components to
replicate manufacturing practices.</p>

<p>PCB printing and construction-related costs were left out of the bill
of materials for simplicity sake.</p>
<p>The plastic shell of the calculator was determined to be made of high
impact polystyrene (HIPS), which is commonly used for its ability to
provide impact resistance, rigidity, and dimensional stability at a
relatively low cost <a
href="#ref11">[11]</a>.</p>
<p>Thermoplastic elastomers (TPEs) were chosen as the base material for
the keyboard because they are very similar in feel and appearance to
silicone rubbers, but they are more cost effective and easier to
manufacture <a
href="#ref12">[12]</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Total Cost: $5.96</strong></p>
<p>The actual calculator retails direct from the manufacturer for $7.41
<a href="#ref13">[13]</a>. It can
be assumed that CASIO isn’t settling for a mere $1.45 in profit (not
including manufacturing, packaging, and processing costs); instead, they
likely have numerous manufacturing contracts and first-party suppliers
to reduce costs far below what has been estimated.</p>
