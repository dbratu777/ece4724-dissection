The keyboard serves as the primary point of user interaction with the device; it provides a number of potential actions or operations to the user depending on the current state. As shown in the above figure, green states represent actions available the user at any point; although, many of them may not produce the desired behavior unless specific conditions are met, such as the memory operations. Yellow states require the preceding states or conditions to have occurred before they are available to the user. Red states are terminal states managed and determined by the device's internal logic.

Based on the timing diagrams and pin analysis, it was concluded that the LCD is multiplexed, or dynamic, and operates using a 1/3 bias driving scheme, as illustrated in Timing Diagram 2. The bias reference signal has a period that is one-third that of the common plane and segment signals (Timing Diagram 1 and 3 respectively), and these signals exhibit three distinct voltage levels: ground (0V), common plane peak/trough (±1.26V), and segment peak/trough (±1.42V). The bias reference signal oscillates within this voltage range, further supporting its role in biasing the LCD.

Additionally, analysis of the 27-pin interface revealed the presence of 3 common plane pins and 23 segment pins, which together support all 69 segments on the display (made up of 8 seven-segment digits, 8 decimal points, 2 commas, 1 negative sign, and 2 memory operation indicators). This leaves a single unaccounted-for pin, which (given the absence of an integrated driver IC on the LCD) is most reasonably attributed to a bias reference input.

Interestingly, regardless of the number of digits input or the type of digit (0-9), all numerical segment pins seemingly produce the same AC signals; there was no difference in voltage amplitude, signal shape, or RMS values within the pin grouping. This behavior is expected because multiplexed LCDs use time-division control, where all segment pins are driven with similar waveforms; the relative timing between segment and common signals is what determines the display output not the shape or amplitude of a single pin’s waveform. Regardless, this makes it difficult to determine exactly which pins line up with which segments.

*Period: 16.10ms*

The keyboard follows a standard multiplexed row-column arrangement, where each keypress generates two separate signals sent to the microcontroller. The microcontroller uses the origin of these signals (which row and column are involved) to determine which key was pressed and then decide the appropriate response. The timing diagram above shows only the signal corresponding to one of the inputs generated by a button press.
