**Timing Diagram 4: Keypad Button Press**  

The keyboard is in a standard, multiplexed, row-column arrangement, meaning each key-press results in two separate signals being sent to the microcontroller; the microconroller would use the input origin of each signal to determine which key was pressed and decide the appropriate response. The above timing diagram only shows the reading from one of the signals generated from such a button-press.
