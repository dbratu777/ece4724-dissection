<h3 id="measuring-capacitor-and-diode-ratings">Measuring Capacitor and
    Diode Ratings</h3>
<p>While it wasn’t pertinent to understanding the intended functionality
    of the circuit in this dissection, understanding how capacitors and
    diodes function and how their ratings affect said function may be
    required for this purpose. However, it did prove useful for somewhat
    accurately determining the bill of materials for the SL-100L
    calculator.</p>
<h3 id="taking-and-reading-timing-diagrams">Taking and Reading Timing
    Diagrams</h3>
<p>Timing diagrams can provide invaluable insight into component
    implementation and the logic driving a system. Everything from the
    recorded voltage levels to the frequency of a signal can help determine
    how specific components are being utilized or provide hints to the
    underlying logic driving them. For example, the timing diagrams recorded
    as a part of this dissection revealed the bias of the LCD and the
    debouncing logic used to receive stable input from the keypad.</p>
<h3 id="general-component-analysis">General Component Analysis</h3>
<p>Understanding the specifications of individual components may help to
    prevent the misinterpretation of the system’s overall functionality or
    implementation. For example, there are multiple ways to drive LCDs;
    knowing these variations exist and their subtle or not-so subtle
    differences helps drive the analysis of measurements or the general
    circuit to determine which implementation is in use in a given system.
    With regards to this dissection, simply looking at the number of traces
    connecting the LCD to the microcontroller and knowing how many segments
    the LCD contains revealed that it was dynamically driven and not
    static.</p>
<h3 id="markdown">Markdown</h3>
<p>Unrelated to the performing of the dissection itself, this report has
    been fully written and formatted using Markdown as a base before being
    translated to HTML. Overall, a deeper appreciation for Markdown and an
    understanding of its versatility/original purpose was developed as a
    part of this effort.</p>
<h3 id="additional-experiences">Additional Experiences</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Flex-cables are not as fragile as they first appear, yet one should
        still refrain from bending or twisting them</li>
    <li>Wire insulation should be stripped to a reasonable length before
        soldering lest one wishes to meld it with their solder</li>
    <li>One should always watch the tip of their iron closely</li>
    <li>Screws are prone to becoming lost</li>
</ul>
