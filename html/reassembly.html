<p><strong>Figure 1: Primary PCB with C3, C4, and D2 Removed for Rating
        Measurements</strong></p>
<p>All traces to the LCD and battery were scratched to remove their
    protective layering, which allowed for measurements and timing diagrams
    to be acquired. Select traces to the keypad and solar cells were also
    scratched for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Some of the plastic tabs on the top of the shell were damaged during
    the disassembly process and are now unable to properly latch.</p>

<p>Aside from minor damage to the external shell and the loss of a
    screw, the device is fully functional. The PCB was cleaned with
    isopropyl alcohol, and all exposed traces on the primary PCB were coated
    with clear nail polish to help prevent potential degradation of the
    traces.</p>
