## Lessons

* How to test capacitor and diode ratings
* How to take timing diagrams
* Flex-cables are not as fragile as initially thought
* Wire coatings should be stripped to a reasonable length before soldering (this one is relearned quite often... lots of melted ends...)
* Watch the soldering iron's position both while in-use and when setting it down (another one that is relearned more often than it should be...)
* Screws can be very small and hard to find once lost
