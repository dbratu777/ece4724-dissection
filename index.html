    <h2 id="personal-introduction">Personal Introduction</h2>
    <p>This device tear-down and analysis was performed and recorded by
        Daniel Bratu (dab755), a senior Computer Engineering undergraduate, in
        Spring 2025. It was executed as a part of the semester-long dissection
        project in Mississippi State University’s ECE-4724 Embedded Systems
        course under Dr. Vuk Marojevic.</p>
    <p>Daniel has been digitally captured and provided in Figure 1 for
        reference.</p>

    <p>A CASIO SL-100L Dual Leaf Pocket Calculator was chosen as the subject
        of this dissection. The dissection proposal quad chart created as a part
        of the selection effort is showcased in Figure 2 for archival
        purposes.</p>

    <p>The following subsections cover much of the same information as the
        quad chart in additional detail.</p>
    <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
    <p>The SL-100L is a basic folding calculator with no scientific
        functions and limited memory operations; it is capable of standard
        mathematical operations using only a single binary or unary operator at
        a time. It has two power sources: a button cell battery and solar cells.
        The calculator utilizes a 8-digit 7-segment LCD for the display.</p>
    <h3 id="motivation">Motivation</h3>
    <p>A calculator was chosen for this dissection because calculators as a
        whole are readily available and widely used devices. Additionally, basic
        non-scientific, non-graphing calculators are textbook examples of
        embedded systems: they are non-programmable, application-specific
        devices that use several user-facing input/output components, such as
        LCDs and keypads. Furthermore, studying the inner-workings of a
        calculator serves as an excellent entry point into embedded systems, as
        they typically lack complex or confusing circuitry, thus allowing the
        person performing the dissection to focus on understanding the embedded
        applications without necessarily being overwhelmed by the device’s
        underlying electrical implementation.</p>
