## Personal Introduction



## Product Introduction

A CASIO SL-100L Dual Leaf Pocket Calculator, pictured below, was chosen as the subject of this dissection.

### Background

The SL-100L is a basic folding calculator with no scientific functions and limited memory operations; it is capable of standard mathematical operations using only a single binary or unary operator at a time. It has two power sources: a button cell battery and solar cells. Also, the calculator utilizes a 8-digit 7-segment LCD for the display.

### Motivation

A calculator was chosen for this dissection because calculators as a whole are readily available and widely used devices. Additionally, basic non-scientific, non-graphing calculators are textbook examples of embedded systems: they are non-programmable, application-specific devices that use several user-facing input/output components, such as LCDs and keypads. Furthermore, studying the inner-workings of a calculator serves as an excellent entry point into embedded systems, as they typically lack complex or confusing circuitry; this allows the person performing the dissection to focus on understanding the embedded applications without necessarily being overwhelmed by the device’s underlying electrical operations.
